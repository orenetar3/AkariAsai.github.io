I am currently in my 5th year of pursuing a Ph.D. in NLP at Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/index.html). I am also spending some time at [Meta AI Research](https://ai.meta.com/research/) as a visiting student researcher, under the supervision of [Dr. Wen-tau Yih](https://scottyih.org/). Prior to joining UW, I obtained a B.E. in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.ee.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) from The University of Tokyo, Japan, where I also studied Economics during my first two years of study.

My primary research interests are centered around natural language processing and machine learning.
My research is driven by a desire to create NLP systems that are both practical and impactful, with the ultimate goal of improving access to information for people from all walks of life.
Recently, my research has focused on several key areas, including:


- **Retrieval-augmented LMs** -- I've pioneered and advanced the area of retrieval-augmented LMs to build more reliable, adaptable and attributable intelligent systems: [Self-RAG (ICLR 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511), [Adaptive Retrieval-augmented LM (ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10511), [Evidentiality-guided RAG (NAACL 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08688), [FAVA, Retrieval-augmented LM for Fine-grained Hallucination Detections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06855). I've co-taught [the first tutorial of retrieval-augmented LMs](https://acl2023-retrieval-lm.github.io/) at ACL 2023.


- **General-purpose knowledge retrieval systems** -- Reliable retrieval systems are the key to build powerful and successful retrieval-augmented LMs. I've developed advanced search and representations systems that better capture complex real-world user queries, robust to diverse domains, and are more efficient: [Path Retriever (ICLR 2020)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SJgVHkrYDH), the [first Instructable Retriever (Findings of ACL 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09260), [LUKE (EMNLP 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01057), and [Binary Passage Retriever (ACL 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00882). Our methods have been integrated into multiple real-world systems, such as [COVID-19 Research Search](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-research-develops-new-search-engine-to-support-the-fight-against-covid-19/).


- **Serving intelligent systems for more people** -- Today's NLP systems are primarily developed and tested on a handful of high-resource languages, leaving many world languages left behind. I believe developing NLP systems accessible for everyone is important. I've been contributing to the area of multilingual NLP, in particular, advancing our understanding of NLP in low-resource setups and developing systems that can help linguistic minoarities to access the information they need: [XOR QA (NAACL 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11856), [CORA (NeurIPS 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11976), [BUFFET](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14857) and [Large-scale meta survey on multilingual resources (Findings of EMNLP 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15649). I was the lead organizer of [Workshop on Multilingual Information Access](https://mia-workshop.github.io/) at NAACL 2022 and hosted the first cross-lingual retrieval and open-domain QA shared task. This line of my work was featured in [UW CSE News](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2022/10/20/lost-in-translation-no-more-ibm-fellowship-winner-akari-asai-asks-and-answers-big-questions-in-nlp-to-expand-information-access-to-all/).

I am also passionate about teaching, mentoring and helping students to learn research, especially students from underrepresented groups.
I have been the Head TA for [CSE473: Intro to AI (undergrad)](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/23au/) and [CSE599J: Data-centric ML (grad)](https://koh.pw/cse599j/) at UW.  To reduce the barrier to start research or Ph.D. in this area, I'm hosting weekly office hours open to everyone (please sign up from [Calendly](https://calendly.com/akari-asai/office-hour)!), and am a mentor for [UW CSE Ph.D. Pre-Application Mentorship Service (PAMS)](https://www.cs.washington.edu/academics/phd/admissions/pams).
